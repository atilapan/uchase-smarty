This repository contains a small Chrome Extension I built as a **personal learning exercise**. 
The main focus was to explore how Chrome Extensions work, how to intercept and manipulate URL patterns.

## Features
- Built with the **Chrome Extensions API** (Manifest V3).  
- Demonstrates **URL pattern recognition and replacement**.  
- Uses background and content scripts for handling logic.  
- Organized project structure for easy exploration.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes
- Extension is written in **JavaScript**.  
- Uses a `manifest.json` file (Manifest V3).  
- Can be loaded as an **unpacked extension** in Chrome for testing.
